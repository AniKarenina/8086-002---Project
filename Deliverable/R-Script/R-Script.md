We have addressed all our research questions.

1) Finding out on which claim type did all the hospital across USA has spent more and also for which period?  
2) Finding the amount spent in each state and grouping it under highest and lowest claim states?  
3) Finding the leading hospital in terms of spending based on the US zones and also finding the differences in spending by hospital on zone level?
